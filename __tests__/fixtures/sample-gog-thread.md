Hi team,

I wanted to share an update on the project timeline. We've completed the first phase of development and are moving into testing.

Key milestones:
- Phase 1: Complete
- Phase 2: Testing begins next week
- Phase 3: Target launch March 15

Let me know if you have questions.

Best,
Alice

Thanks Alice! A few questions:

1. Do we have enough test coverage for the API endpoints?
2. Should we schedule a code review before Phase 2?
3. What's the rollback plan if testing reveals blockers?

I can help coordinate the testing effort if needed.

Bob

Great progress! I'll handle the test coverage review.

@Bob - I agree we should do a code review. Let's schedule it for Wednesday.
